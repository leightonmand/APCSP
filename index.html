		<p> One of my favorite movies, Interstellar, is about an ending world where the only chance of survival is finding another habitable planet. Cooper has to leave his kids to take a trip through space, unable to predict how long he is going to be gone for because of the time dilation. Through the movie, many laws and theories of space are expressed and challanged, intriguing my interest of space. </p>
